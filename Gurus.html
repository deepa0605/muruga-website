        <h3>Om Gurunatha Jaya Gurunatha</h3><br>
        <h5>Guru Govind dono khade kake lagu paay<br>
            Balihari Guru aapki Govind diyo batay.</h5>
            <br><p>As Kabir Das says in this couplet, that he would prostrate to the Guru first, when both Guru and God appear before him.  Saint Eknath also did not want to see anybody other than his Guru Janardhana Swami.  He was unmoved when his Guru graced him with the darshan of Lord Dattatreya.  Even at the moment of his samadhi, he saw his Guru in each and every being around him.  On the lines of the same sampradaya, Muruga's concert always begins with Guru namavali (Om Gurunatha Jaya Gurunatha) and Guru Vandanam (Guruvukke en vanakkam, Aajaski sadguru ghar aaye, Shakthi Swaroopa Sri Sadguru paadam).<br>
             <br>   His gurus are 
                <span>Brahmananda Paradesiyar, Pampaati Siddhar, Vallimalai Sachidananda Swamigal, Kanjanhad Swami Ramdas and Krishna Bai.</span></p>
        <br><br><br><h3>Brahmananda Paradesiyar</h3>
        <p>Brahamananda Paradesiyar is a saint, and a vocalist of 19th century who was known for his pallavi singing.  When he saw 'Muruga', he immediately called him 'Pithukuli' and told him that he would become like him one day.  Pithukuli in Tamil means 'one who is crazy or mad'.  From then the name held on.
        </p><br><br><br>
        <img src="pambatti.jpg" class="pic1" alt="1">
        <br><br><h3>Pambaati Siddhar</h3><br>
        <p>Pambatti Siddhar is the last of the eighteen siddhars in the siddhar tradition.  He did severe penance in a cave in Marudamalai.  The cave can be seen even today when one visits Marudamalai Murugan temple.  More information on Pambatti Siddhar can be found at: http://www.siddhars.com/pambatti.htm
        </p><br><br><br><br>
        <br><img src="vallimalai.jpg" class="pic2" alt="2"><br>
        <h3>Vallimalai Sachidananda Swamigal</h3><br>
        <p>Vallimalai Sachidananda Swamigal is also called as Vallimalai Thirupugazh Swamigal.  Once in Coimbatore, Vallimalai Swamigal saw Muruga and asked him to sing a Thirupugazh.  But, Muruga answered that he did not know any Thirupugazh.  So, Swamigal asked Muruga to sing any song on Lord Muruga.  To this Muruga readily agreed and he sang 'Kaithalam Niraikani'.  Swamigal then told Muruga," Ethu thaan da Thirupugazh.  Ennoda varaya unaku naan naraya Thiruppugazh solli tharen."  (This is Thirupugazh, if you can come with me I will teach you many such songs/verses from Thiruppugazh)
        <br><br>So, Muruga went with him and stayed in the Vallimalai caves for many years and learnt Thiruppugazh, Vel Vaguppu, Seer Pada Vaguppu, etc.  Daily Swamigal would say the number of people that Muruga & other disciples need to cook for lunch.  He would come up with some number like 30 or 40, whereas people there would only be very less.  But at the luch time about noon there would so many people by the cave totally tired and thristy, wanting food.  All the cooked food would be served to them and they would all go away with theirs stomachs full and hearts happy.
